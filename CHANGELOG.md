# Changelog

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Server versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) and are published by the `server-vX.Y.Z` tag.

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Protocol

- `session.start` accepts the optional field `turn_end` (`"auto"` or `"manual"`, absent = `"auto"`). Additive change within protocol 1; servers 0.1.x ignore the field and run every call as `"auto"`. See [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md#end-of-the-users-turn).

### Server (`server/`)

- Added: per call end of turn mode. `"auto"` keeps the current behaviour (silence, mute or duration limit). `"manual"` never ends the turn by silence: only the mute or the duration limit end it, and every frame from the start of speech is kept, pauses included.
- An unknown `turn_end` value is rejected at opening with `bad_message`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-03

First public release.

### Server (`server/`)

- Protocol v1 between watch and server: pairing over REST and calls over WebSocket with PCM16 audio (16 kHz input, TTS rate on output). Contract in [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md).
- End of turn by silence (Silero v6 VAD or energy based) or by the mute button on the call screen; per turn duration limit.
- Three stage pipeline, swappable through configuration: transcription, responder and voice, with adapters compatible with the OpenAI API and demo providers that need no key.
- Streaming response spoken sentence by sentence, wait for playback on the watch before listening again, and non fatal errors with an apology sentence.
- Named profiles that inherit from the `default` profile.
- Pairing by 8 digit code (valid for 10 minutes, single use) or by manual approval in the CLI; device tokens stored only as hashes in SQLite.
- `wristcall` CLI: `serve`, `pair` and `devices list|approve|revoke`.
- Optional warm-up of transcription and voice models that unload when idle.
- Docker image and `docker-compose.example.yml` with automatic TLS through Caddy.

### Reference client (`tools/refclient/`)

- `wristcall-refclient pair` and `call`, through the computer's microphone or a WAV file, speaking the same protocol as the watch.

### Pairing directory (`directory/`)

- Cloudflare Worker that exchanges the 8 digit code for the server URL. The project's public directory is at `https://wristcall-pair.trigram.com.br`; anyone can run their own.
